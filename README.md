# EDAssitant

EDAssistant is an interactive and visual tool that facilitates exploratory data analysis (EDA) with in-situ code search, exploration, and recommendation based on existing notebook repositories, embedded within the JupyterLab environment for a seamless user experience. 

Based on a large Jupter Notebook corpus collected on Kaggle, EDAssistant employs advanced deep learning models, specially
GraphCodeBERT, to learn a latent representation (i.e., embeddings) of all the EDA sequences.
The backend of EDAssistant contains a search engine for retrieving relevant EDA sequences based on a data scientistâ€™s current code and a recommender for potential APIs to use next, which facilitates their EDA with useful examples and suggestions. 
The frontend of EDAssitant is a visual interface, as a JupyterLab extension, that allows users to conduct EDA while accessing EDAssistant smoothly.
The user interface also features a novel visualization that provides an informative overview of the search results and the coding patterns in EDA notebooks.
